# cmst-135-final
My college class final
The purpose of this site is to give a card shop online presence and promotion.
The pages include the index.html which is the home page that includes basic information on the site and the card shop its based off of.  The tournaments.html is where it explains some of the activites the card shop puts on and a form where you can sign up for one of their tournaments.  The buyCards.html is where the website promotes the cardshops inventory and prices they offer to buy and sell cards.  The contact gives some info on where you can find the card shop and how to get in touch with the company.  The game.html is a p5.js program I made to help players with games they might be playing.  
The color scheme was decided with the help of coolors.co and the pictures are png's with no backgrounds.
The p5 program is not inside the body for some reason and I an't figure out how to fix it but it still functions properly.
From this experience I learned that programming is a long and grueling prosses if you don't know exactly what you're doing and I've gained respect for the big companies with very elaborate websites.
